<h1> These are some of the 101s you can follow that I collected from across socials and verified that they actually work </h1>

<b>
1.Use Chain of Thought for creative n complex task . Adding magic phrase “Think step-by-step” for detailed analysis of task.

2.Create Custom GPT ( or project in Claude) adding a basic overview of your codebase
      i.e. the dependency,deployment and file structure.

3.Plug in the whole gitbook or doc explaining the framework you are using for your project
      For ai to come with updated nd precise code.

4.Use the AI in modular form i.e. solving one part of problem in one chat session.

5.Use clear and specific prompts. The more precise and detailed your request, the better the AI        can understand and generate the code you need. Include details about the desired functionality: input/output type, error handling, UI behaviour etc. Spend time on writing a good prompt like if you were spending time explaining your task to a human.

7.Ask AI to include detailed comments explaining the logic of the generated code. This can help you and the AI understand the code better and make future modifications easier.

8.Ask AI to review the its own code with clever phrases like “ r u sure” , ask it to optimise the code for good performance like a good cp will do.

9.Get docs. Beyond just inline comments, ask the AI to create documentation for your code. Some README file, API docs, and maybe even user guides. This will make your life WAY easier later when you decide to sell your startup or hire a dev.

10.Always use AI for generating database queries and schemas. These things are easy to mess up. So let the AI do the dull work. it is pretty great at composing things like DB schemas, SQL queries, regexes.

11.Understand the code you paste. YOU are responsible for your app, not the AI. So you have to know what is happening under your startup's hood. if AI gives you a piece of code you do not understand, make sure you read the docs or talk to AI to know how it works.</b>
